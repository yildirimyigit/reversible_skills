StackBlocks core predicates (2-block tower).

Interpretation:
- red_block_1 is the bottom block of the final tower.
- red_block_2 is the top block of the final tower.

PRE means:
- both blocks start separately on the table and are clear.

POST means:
- red_block_2 is stacked on red_block_1 with stable contact.

Incidental changes are allowed (robot final pose, other blocks moved slightly, etc.).
